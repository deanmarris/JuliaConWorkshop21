# VSCode basics
Somewhat similar to Juno/Atom (and Sublime Text, to a lesser extent)

- Main mode of interaction: Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-P, F1)
- Search for `Julia:` prefix to find commands, e.g. `Julia: Start REPL`
- Terminal
- Toolbar:
    - Explorer -> Workspace folders
    - Search
    - Git
    - Debugger
    - Extensions
    - Julia
        - Workspace
        - Documentation
        - Plot navigator

# Useful settings and extensions

- Set `julia.execution.resultType` to `inline` or `both`
- Set `editor.fontFamily` to JuliaMono (https://juliamono.netlify.app/). You won't regret it!
- GitLens for better git integration
- vscode-pdf
- Remote - SSH
